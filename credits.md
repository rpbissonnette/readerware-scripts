Readerware Liberator v1.0
=========================
- Core Parser & Schema Reverse-Engineering: Grok (xAI) – for cracking the .bkup.script black box
- TAB Merger & Batch Logic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Kiro IDE) – for the elegant, error-proof importer
- Debugging, UX Vision, & Final Polish: rpbissonnette (me) – the one who made it real
- Special Thanks: The MobileRead forums (for the original 2008 Python snippets that started it all)
